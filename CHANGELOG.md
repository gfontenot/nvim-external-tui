## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2024-12-02

### Added
- Initial release. Includes base functionality, but some of the APIs changed
during initial development. These changes will be formalized in 1.0, so this
release exists to give users a target to use before these deprecated fields
are removed.

### Deprecated
- `text_arg` option renamed to `text_flag` (will be removed in 1.0)
